    "text": "its remarkable that nba lottery system has been around this long without things getting _that_ bad\n\nunder certain conditions, teams are rewarded for losing games. of course they will intentionally lose games! incentives are broken\n\nits more fundamental than that though. teams are only indirectly rewarded for winning games through better tv deals, demand for games, merchandise sales. i wager team revenue increasingly decouples from winning games over time because of celebrity players\n\nthis might happen with lebron's final season, has arguably already happened with lebron on the lakers. his farewell tour will do crazy ticket sales, and he will be probably a ~0 VORP player, but wouldn't be surprised if teams would trade substantial assets to grab the revenue.\n\neventually there will be a larger reckoning similar about misaligned incentives. nba will have a choice then: have teams participate in revenue sharing, or become a pure entertainment league a la savannah bananas. 50/50 either way i think.\n\nim cautiously optimistic nba will do team revenue sharing (s.t. teams are rewarded for winning games, playoff performance) because of gambling partnerships and money prize for nba cup. seems like nba has broken through a lot of the taboos around money/competing for money/financial incentives for people who are already rich",
